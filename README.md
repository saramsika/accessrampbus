# accessrampbus

The access ramp will serve people with reduced mobility to access the bus. The innovative aspect about the project is that the access ramp is dedicated to buses with stairs :

Function mode :
[01] The first cylinder actuates the top support.
[02] The top support is therefore put into translation.
[03] The plate is mounted in pivot with the support, so it follows the latter in its translation movement.
[04] The plate is guided by grooves at the level of the housing, the latter contains also pants for cooling.
[05] When the cylinder ends its stroke, the plate is completely outside the housing
[06] At this moment, three pneumatic micro-cylinders lift the plate, thus ensuring a contact at two points: the entrance to the bus and the walk. (See the finite element study). These points are obtained only with an angle of 18 degrees, taking into account the dimensions of the plate, and those of the bus. (Both are fixed).
[6.5] The rotational movement is ensured by the pivot connection between the support and the plate.
[07] The double-acting cylinder is activated, the plate moves back until it is placed on the
two points of contact.
[08] The second cylinder, identical to the first, is activated.
[09] The jack allows to translate the second plate.
[10] The translation movement is guided by grooves in the case.
[11] Thanks to the particular shape of the case which contains rounded edges at its end, the platefalls by gravity.
[12] The low plate falls completely to the ground.
[13] The contact between the bottom plate and the ground is ensured by wheels, which allow to avoid friction.
[14] The plate continues its movement until it has the correct alignment between the two plates, on the support pivot connection - high plate.
[15] The actuator is stopped by the sensor which detects the alignment.
[16] The user can now get on the bus
[17] To store the system, follow steps 15 to 1 (reverse order).
